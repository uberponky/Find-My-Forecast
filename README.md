# find-my-forecast

An interactive webpage that allows visitors to find weather forecasts by location.

## Description

This repository contains a simple browser tool that allows visitors to find weather forecasts by location. Upon entering their chosen location, the site performs basic validation on the input and then makes calls to 3 separate APIs from the api.openweathermap.org website.

Upon making successful calls , the current and 5 day forecast are dynamically displayed.

The users search history is saved to the browsers local storage, and is displayed in a box, allowing users to easily search that location again.

The application was built using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, JqueryUI, DayJS and Bootstrap.

Features include:
* A search box that dynamically updates the page upon entering a location
* A current and 5 day forecast
* Simple, modern styling
* Previous search history
